# LDL - Learning Deep-Learning

This is my progress of learning Deep-Learning using several tools established withing the Python community.

### Tasks
- Tasks called "n-Aufgabe", n $$\in$$ $$\mathbb{N}$$ are from the BWKI [(Bundeswettbewerb KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz)](https://www.bw-ki.de/) which is publishing their [weekly tasks](https://github.com/bethgelab/bwki-weekly-tasks) on github.
- Regression tasks are from [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html), Datasets used are:
  - [Simple linear regression](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression)
  - [Multiple linear regression](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hussainnasirkhan/multiple-linear-regression-dataset)
- Classification task is inspired from [Credit Score Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/credit-score-classification-dataset)

### Goals of the Project
Aim of the project is to get to know the various deep learning tools.
